# Enable Damage Counter

In the early footage of Marvel vs Capcom 3: Fate of Two Great Buddies, there was a little number under the combo counter that kept track of the current combo damage.

"That's sick as hell", a young sheep thought to himself, but alas, when the game was released this number was nowhere to be found.

But fret not, the feature has lain dormant in the game for all this time, waiting to be rediscovered, and can be re-enabled using this mod.

## Usage

1. Make sure you've got [the Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/) installed in your marvel 3 folder. (If you have the colour expansion kit mod you already have this, if not go read their readme x64 dinput8.dll seems to work fine with marvel)

2. Go to the [latest release page](https://github.com/4423Q/mod_umvc3/releases/latest) and download `mod_enable_damage_counter.asi`.

3. plop it in your marvel folder

4. enjoy
