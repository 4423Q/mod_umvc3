# Toggle Battle HUD

This mod lets you toggle the battle HUD on and off with a keyboard button.

By default this is set to the *space bar*, but you can change it in the .INI config file.

This doesn't turn off some of the optional training mode displays but you can turn those off yourself in the menu.

## Usage

1. Make sure you've got [the Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/) installed in your marvel 3 folder. (If you have the colour expansion kit mod you already have this, if not go read the readme, x64 dinput8.dll seems to work fine with marvel)

2. Go to the [latest release page](https://github.com/4423Q/mod_umvc3/releases/latest) and download `mod_toggle_hud.zip`.

3. Unzip the files, and put `mod_toggle_hud.asi` and `mod_toggle_hud.ini` in the marvel folder next to umvc3.exe

4. Press the space bar (if you haven't changed it in the config file) to toggle the HUD on and off while in the game.
